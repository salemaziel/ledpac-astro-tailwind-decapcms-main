## Who We Are

LEDpac is an innovative LED company designing products and systems for economical and functional application. Founded in 2000, LEDpac has developed products for application in interior coves, cabinets, display cases, signage, downlights, landscape lights and many other applications.

In 2010 LEDpac expanded their product offering to include a broad list of new lamp replacement products including MR16, PAR20, PAR30, BR30 and PAR38 shapes. New, more efficient LED modules in many of the original LEDpac product line has allowed for more effective light distribution and up to 75% higher light output from the same original package.

In 2020 at the outset of the Coronavirus pandemic, LEDpac pivoted to UV-C LED disinfectant products to help fight the virus.

Now, LEDPac has returned to its roots: designing the best LED lighting solutions.
