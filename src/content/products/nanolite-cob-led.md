Chip-on-Board LEDs, also known as COBs, represent the next and newest generation of LED lighting technology. "COB" (Chip-on-Board) refers to the mounting of a bare LED chip in direct contact with a substrate such as silicon carbide to produce LED arrays.

## What Makes COB Technology Superior?

COB LEDs offer several advantages over traditional LED packages:

### Higher Light Density
Multiple LED chips are mounted directly onto the substrate, creating a higher density light source that produces more lumens per square inch.

### Better Heat Management
Direct mounting allows for better thermal management, resulting in longer life and more stable light output.

### Improved Color Mixing
The close proximity of multiple chips creates better color mixing and more uniform light distribution.

### Compact Design
COB technology allows for smaller, more compact lighting fixtures without sacrificing light output.

#### Advantages
- Higher efficiency rate and lower failure rates (reduce 25% of heat)
- High-intensity, particularly at close distances
- High-uniformity, even at close working distances
- Design simplicity, only 1 circuit and 2 contacts are required
